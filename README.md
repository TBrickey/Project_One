# Housing-Analysis

## Project Overview

### Reason
The team plans to examine data related to house sales, conduct exploratory data analysis, train a model that can predict the final sale price of a house, and do feature analysis in order to gain insights. As aspiring future homeowners, we are intrested in learning what to look for when purchasing a house, and what variables we should consider important. 

### Questions to answer
What features will impact housing prices most?
How is the house price data distributed?
Does there appear to be any underlying bias in the data?


### Data Source
[The Boston House-Price Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/the-boston-houseprice-data).

This dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. The dataset is small in size with only 506 cases. The data was originally published by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. `Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.


### Communication
Team members will communicate biweekly through slack and will schedule additonal Zoom meetings as necessary.


### Model
XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way.


### Database
AWS and Postgres connected with SQLAlchemy.
