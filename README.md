# Housing-Analysis

## Purpose
Will use housing market databases to train a model to predict housing prices. As aspiring future homeowners, we are intrested in examining house prices. Through this project we will answer: What features will impact housing prices? This analysis will be based off [The Boston House-Price Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/the-boston-houseprice-data).

### Communication
Team members will communicate biweekly through slack and will meet through Zoom.
